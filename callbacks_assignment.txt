1. The differencce between readdir and readdirSync is that 
readdir is an asynchronous, non-blocking method to read a directory 
while readdirSync is a synchronous, blocking method to read a directory.
When readdirSync is called, no additional code can be called until it is finished executing.

2. The event loop is a system to process events sequentially from the event queue.
If the event is asynchronous, node asks the operating system to notify it when the 
event is ready for processing. Meanwhile, it continues to process other events in the queue.

3. This code is synchronous and blocking.

4. This code is asynchronous and non-blocking.

5. The console.log statements will execute C, A, B. 

6. The functions will run hello() followed by greeting() because the 
setTimeout function adds the function to the task queue for the timeout and moves 
on to call hello().

7. 
console.log("Hi");

setTimeout(function timeout() {
    console.log("Timeout Finished");
}, 5000);

console.log("Done");
